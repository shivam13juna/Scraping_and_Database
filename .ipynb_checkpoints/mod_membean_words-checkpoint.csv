Marjory thought that Max’s outdated habits were charming in an Old World sort of way, but she disagreed with his antediluvian beliefs about women’s place in society, which were anything but up-to-date.

These arboreal dwellers, thought to be the ancestors of birds, may have relied upon gliding as their primary means of transportation from tree to tree in search of food and shelter.

Hence, the power of both the word and the sword led to power or hegemony over the whole of Gaul in a mere five years."
Heinous,A severe punishment and public anger.,From a root word meaning “to hate”:  A heinous crime is surely something to be “hated.”,"abhor, abject, abominate, depravity, despicable, diabolical, egregious, flagrant, malevolent, malfeasance, malice, nefarious, noisome, noxious, odious, pernicious, reprehensible, repugnance","benefaction, benign, congenial, desiderata, inconspicuous, innocuous, philanthropy, propitious, salutary, unassuming, unobtrusive",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/heinous.mp4,," Chief medical examiner Clarins was called to the morgue to investigate the tragic results of a shocking, hateful, heinous crime.  A young man had been left to die painfully in the bitter cold, an unspeakably tragic and heinous event that caused a huge stir in the small town.  Dr. Clarins was eventually able to provide evidence that helped solve the baffling case and punish those who committed the evil, unthinkable, and heinous deed."
Heretic,They argue against things that most people agree are true.,"A heretic “chooses” a way of thought different from widely held, traditional beliefs.","aberrant, agnostic, apostate, awry, bohemian, delusive, dissident, eccentric, errant, fallacy, heterodox, iconoclast, idolatry, nonpartisan, obdurate, schism","credulous, docile, dogmatic, ecclesiastical, parochial, statutory, tenet",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/heretic.mp4,ConanThis guy is a somewhat of a heretic when it comes to his opinion of Star Wars.," William Callower did not believe in marriage, which in his community was held as sacred; hence, William was considered a rebellious, free-thinking heretic .  In a heretical , oppositional statement, William argued that no one should ever marry when they could just live together.  His beliefs against marriage were considered heresy , especially since his father was a pastor and his mother ran her own wedding design business.  How could such a very different thinker, such a heretic , come from the traditional Callower family?"
Hermetic,To close others out to keep from their interference or influence.,"Hermetic is derived from “Hermes,” the Greek messenger and science god, and author of secret and mysterious texts on alchemy (the science of converting lead into gold).  Hermes was believed to have possessed the ability to seal treasure chests so that nothing could access them. In the 17th century English writers began using hermetic to mean anything that was “sealed” or “secret.”  Subsequently hermetic has been used to refer to something sealed so tightly that it is “airtight.”","abstruse, arcane, cloister, conundrum, covert, enigmatic, esoteric, impervious, latent, recluse, recondite, surreptitious","apprise, broach, disinter, divulge, elucidate, evince, exude, gloss, overt, patent, permeate",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hermetic.mp4,," Sheryl says that in college she had an airtight, hermetic seal on her heart: she wouldn’t let anyone in.  Sheryl created an entirely hermetic world into which very few people were allowed access of any kind.  The closed-off, hermetic confines of her life meant that she was alone much of the time, for she did not invite advice or intimacy from even her closest friends.  She seems to feel that her isolated, hermetic existence kept her free from other people’s control, influence, and interference."
Heterodox,When it differs completely from those that are accepted.,"When one thinks in a heterodox fashion, one holds a “different opinion” than everybody else.","aberrant, agnostic, apocryphal, apostate, autonomous, awry, bohemian, delusive, dissident, divisive, eccentric, errant, fallacy, heretic, iconoclast, nonpartisan, schism","acquiesce, adherent, credulous, demure, docile, dogmatic, ecclesiastical, parochial, servile, statutory, subservient, tenet",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/heterodox.mp4,," Warren wondered if he should continue going to church since his own heterodox beliefs were opposed to those of the congregation.  He wasn’t sure if he believed in a creator or a higher power anymore; this heterodox , differing concept would surely get him into trouble with the priest.  Warren began to think that it might be time to consider other religious practices since his increasingly heterodox , doubtful, and disbelieving views clashed with Christian principles in general."
Heuristic,When you learn from it by doing it yourself.,"From a root word meaning “to find.”  If a student follows a heuristic method of learning, she “finds” out truths for herself.","conjecture, dialectic, empirical, hypothetical, notional, pedagogy, postulate, pragmatic, putative, skeptic, tentative, utilitarian, verisimilitude","axiom, disinterested, dogmatic, figurative, monolith, oblivious, precept, statutory, tenet",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/heuristic.mp4,," In the wilderness, it seems that animals rely on trial by error, or a heuristic method of learning.  Although female bears teach their young cubs how to fish, what to eat, and where to find food, many discoveries do happen in a questioning, heuristic way.  Cubs learn, for example, which tree limbs will not support them only when branches break beneath their weight.  It could be said that nature is a school that teaches through heuristic , experiential, and trial-by-fire methods."
Hiatus,An athlete who stops competing for a few months to recover from an injury.,"To “gape” is to “open wide.”  Hence, a hiatus creates a “hole” in an activity that “interrupts” its flow.","abate, abeyance, lacuna, moratorium, respite","arduous, assiduous, chronic, indefatigable, interminable, laborious, perennial, pertinacious, sedulous, steadfast, tenacious, unflagging, unremitting",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hiatus.mp4,O Brother Where Art ThouThere is a hiatus during their meal.," Warren was working too hard, so he decided to take a much needed hiatus or break from Wall Street.  Taking a couple of weeks to rest at his cabin in Vermont would give him the quiet hiatus from the city that Warren needed.  Away from the demanding hours and hectic stress of his job, Warren spent the hiatus away from the office chopping wood and skiing over the Vermont snow."
Hierarchy,A system in society or an organization by which people are ranked by order of importance.,"A hierarchy originally referred to the “state of rule by the holy,” that is, the order of power that was held by different types of angels; in due course it began to refer to members of the church, beginning with the chief priest on down.  Later on the word began being used by organizations other than religious institutions to once again indicate levels of power.","apportion, echelon, gradation, hegemony, patriarch, serried, taxonomy, tertiary, triage","autocratic, autonomous, divest, homogeneous, usurp",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hierarchy.mp4,YouTube: Daniel Man of ReasonMaslow's hierarchy of needs.," As a new employee in the company, Louise held the lowest position in the office hierarchy .  Not only was her desk in the smallest windowless corner, but she was also the one sent to fetch coffee for those staff members who enjoyed a higher place in the hierarchy than she did.  The strict order of the business hierarchy even regulated where everyone sat at the meeting table.  Louise hoped that she would move up the company hierarchy or personnel ranking soon."
Histrionic,When it is falsely emotional and overly loud.,Someone who acts in a histrionic fashion behaves “like an actor” might on stage.,"accentuate, boisterous, bombastic, bumptious, expostulate, flamboyant, florid, grandiloquent, impertinent, mawkish, ostentatious, pontificate, stentorian, vaunted","decorous, demure, diffident, inconspicuous, irreproachable, politic, reticent, skittish, timorous, unassuming, unobtrusive",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/histrionic.mp4,," The cast was surprised by the lead singer’s outrageous temper tantrums and other histrionic behavior at rehearsals.  While all knew that Serge Sampson had an emotional personality, no one had expected a professional actor to indulge in theatrical, histrionic fits.  When Serge left the stage yelling and waving his arms in yet another histrionic display, the director raised an eyebrow and wondered to himself when Serge’s absurd behavior would end."
Homily,A speech or piece of writing giving advice on how to behave.,A homily is the “activity” of moralizing “discourse.”,"diatribe, edification, ennui, excoriate, harangue, inveigh, peroration, pontificate, rant, soliloquy, tedium, thematic, tirade, treatise, vituperative","encomium, eulogy, extol, laudatory, paean, panegyric, plaudit",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/homily.mp4,," When Theodore came home from school soaked by the rain, his mother immediately scolded him with a sharp homily about being prepared.  “Why you didn’t bring an umbrella to school is beyond me!” she snapped in an ongoing, judgmental homily .  As he listened to his mother’s unwelcome advice or homily about what he should have done, Theodore sighed and dripped water onto the kitchen floor.  Such homilies were nothing new to Theo, who received unwanted, strict lectures every day."
Homogeneous,When the members of that group are almost identical in their ways.,"When parts of a whole “resemble” the “same kind, type, or class” as other parts, they are said to be homogeneous.","equanimity, immutable, monolith, steadfast, unadorned","ambiguous, dichotomy, discordant, disparate, dissonance, divisive, echelon, eclectic, ecumenical, equivocate, heterodox, incongruous, irreconcilable, multifarious, ornate, oscillate, variegated, waver",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/homogeneous.mp4,Being John MalkovichThe people at this restaurant are homogeneous.," Rachel thought that the “popular crowd” at school looked and acted alike, seeming completely homogeneous or identical.  This group of girls wore the same kind of clothing and fixed their hair in the same, homogeneous style.  They even spoke in a similar, homogeneous tone of voice that seemed to end every sentence with a lilt, as if they were always asking questions.  With her short, dark hair and thrift store clothes that she had redesigned, Rachel was glad not to match the homogeneous crowd which to her looked like paper dolls."
Homologous,When it has a similar use or design as the second thing.,"Things that are homologous “possess” the “same calculation or ratio,” that is, they have a “sameness” about them.","analogous, concordant, homogeneous, juxtaposition, pertinent, reciprocate, semblance, surrogate, tantamount","ambiguous, anomaly, discordant, disparate, divisive, incommensurate, incongruous, irreconcilable",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/homologous.mp4,," What is the homologous relationship between the similar acts of physically writing a letter that you send in the mail and sending an e-mail?  What about the homologous or related activities of talking to someone face-to-face, or communicating with them on Facebook?  Or performing the homologous acts of chatting with someone on a cell phone versus using Skype to communicate on the Internet?  All these homologous , corresponding functions have a common origin: the need to communicate with other human beings."
Hubris,Overbearing vanity and focus on the greatness of the self.,"From a root word meaning “wanton violence, outrage, insolence.”  If one demonstrates hubris, one’s excessive self-importance is a form of “insolence” or “outrage” upon acceptable behavior and social norms.","affront, brazen, bumptious, effrontery, hauteur, imperious, impertinent, impudence, overweening, patronize, presumptuous, supercilious, temerity","chary, demure, diffident, impassive, inconspicuous, politic, reticent, unassuming, unobtrusive",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hubris.mp4,," Greek drama often tells the story of a man brought down by his own hubris , illustrating the idea that excessive pride comes before a fall.  The authors tell us that it is human nature not to recognize one’s own hubris or flawed, enormous pride.  The more power one acquires the more likely one is to fall into hubris or blind self-importance."
Hyperbole,A way of exaggerating about things.,The use of hyperbole is a “throwing” of words “over or above” the reality of a situation.,"abandon, bombastic, caricature, egregious, exorbitant, figurative, grandiloquent, inordinate, malapropism, overweening, prodigal, profusion, travesty, trope, unbridled","candor, empirical, inconspicuous, objective, probity, unadorned, unassuming, unobtrusive, veracity, verisimilitude, verity",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hyperbole.mp4,OliverOliver's hyperbole is heartfelt., Advertising companies often engage in false and flowery hyperbole or exaggeration.  One ad that uses gross distortion or hyperbole suggests that a type of shampoo can make one’s hair shine as brightly as the sun itself!  Overstatement via the use of hyperbole is so prevalent in the ad industry that consumers have become wise to the fact that they shouldn’t believe everything they hear about advertised products.
Hypochondriac,One who believes that she is highly susceptible to sickness.,"A hypochondriac has symptoms that are “of or pertaining to being under cartilage,” specifically “rib cartilage;” the abdomen lies beneath the ribs, which was once believed to be the center of melancholy or gloominess—a person habitually “depressed” about his overall “health” naturally arose from this earlier concept.","despondent, lugubrious, malaise, malinger, melancholy, morose, plaintive, saturnine, woebegone","blithe, buoyant, convivial, effervescent, exult, impassive, nonchalant, oblivious, salubrious, salutary, sanguine",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hypochondriac.mp4,," My sister is a fearful hypochondriac who either constantly believes herself to be ill or that she is without a doubt coming down with some illness.  As an almost housebound hypochondriac , she worries about her health to the point of distraction.  In fact, my sister rarely goes to parties and misses work often because she fears that she will either contract the flu or is currently sick—such is the life of the hypochondriac ."
Hypothetical,"If everyone owned a flying car, we could all get to work much faster.","A hypothetical notion of something is a guess “placed under” or “put below” it, but which needs further proof to discover whether or not it is actually real or true.","assay, chimerical, conjecture, credence, deliberate, dialectic, discursive, heuristic, irresolute, notional, postulate, putative, tentative, transience, vagary, vicissitude","adduce, aver, axiom, corroborate, empirical, extant, objective, pragmatic, precept, utilitarian, veracity, verisimilitude, verity",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/hypothetical.mp4,Blade RunnerA hypothetical situation is placed before the test taker.," Considering Marian’s usual lateness, the idea that she had hurt herself in an accident was purely hypothetical , that is, based only on a guess.  Her mother supposed, hypothetically , that if Marian had indeed wrecked the car, someone would surely have called her by now.  As she paced the room in worry, Marian’s mother reassured herself with other hypothetical situations: perhaps she had stopped for food, or left town late, or decided to visit a friend.  Anything could have happened to make Marian late, not just the worst hypothesis or possibility."
Iconoclast,When that person attacks widely held beliefs.,"An iconoclast is, at core, an “image breaker,” hence symbolically a severe “critic” of the “images” that institutions and/or established ideas create.","aberrant, agnostic, apostate, autonomous, awry, bohemian, delusive, dissident, divisive, eccentric, errant, factious, fallacy, fractious, heretic, heterodox, nonpartisan, obdurate, schism, sedition","acquiesce, adherent, credulous, demure, docile, dogmatic, ecclesiastical, idolatry, obsequious, parochial, servile, statutory, subservient, tenet",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/iconoclast.mp4,," Thomas was an iconoclast who did not believe in celebrating the winter holidays.  Gift-giving, celebration, or decorating turned him into a fierce unbeliever or iconoclast —he would not participate in those activities, and he would tell others why they shouldn’t as well.  Thomas doubted that all the time, money, and energy used on the holiday season was worth it.  Each year he made his iconoclastic , critical views known loudly at the office holiday party as he stood alone under the mistletoe."
Idiosyncratic,Singing to your houseplants to help them grow.,"Idiosyncratic ideas are one’s “own, personal, or private” views “mixed with” the general belief system; in other words, they are one’s “own” peculiar “mix” of traits.","aberrant, anomaly, chimerical, eccentric, foible, heterodox, iconoclast, intrinsic, notional, predilection, proclivity, propensity, whimsical","clique, hackneyed, homogeneous, mundane, pedestrian, platitude, prosaic",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/idiosyncratic.mp4,"A Christmas StoryThis boy acts in a rather idiosyncratic fashion, which seems to delight his mother."," Ivonne was a genius with an amazing IQ, but her strange and idiosyncratic behavior puzzled some people.  Ivonne would idiosyncratically count each step on every staircase, and she also had the unusual habit of wearing bright orange socks every day.

Penny hadn’t met Josh face to face, but she still idolized him from a distance and sighed with longing for him.  Penny knew everything about Josh from Facebook, and in her idolatry she continued to admire him with blind hero worship.  Penny’s intense idolatry or extreme adoration went away instantly when she found out that Josh was rude and unkind to strangers, including herself."
Idyll,A peaceful dock on a lake where you can sit and enjoy a moment of quiet.,"From a root word meaning “little form, small picture;” in the case of an idyll, this “small picture” is “picture” perfect.  An idyll is also a “small descriptive poem,” usually of a rural, peaceful scene.","blithe, bucolic, buoyant, concordant, enthrall, halcyon, sanguine","austere, despondent, dirge, disaffected, dolorous, lugubrious, pensive, plangent, satire, saturnine, spartan, stentorian, tortuous",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/idyll.mp4,Come Back to JamaicaWhat an idyll Jamaica would be!," That summer in Italy was a golden, perfect idyll that gave us restful pleasure.  The days were long, relaxing and full of idyllic , peaceful activities like drinking wine and gazing at beautiful sunsets while holding hands.

While his public apology seemed heartfelt, his betrayal caused his career to fall under the burden of embarrassing ignominy or dishonor.  The humiliation of his actions increased when the press uncovered additional, ignominious acts of financial fraud and deceit.  The once famous senator was forced to leave the public eye because of the ignominy of his now ruined name and shameful reputation."

Emmet’s grades in science classes in college were good but not great, so his hopes for a successful application to Harvard were illusory or deceptive.

My father could not decide who was in charge of the event, and when Uncle Roy called Dad a demanding jerk, the heated disagreement or imbroglio really got started.  Luckily, I took my grandmother out to lunch while they were planning the party, so she didn’t have to hear the competitive imbroglio or complex struggle between her grown children."

It is difficult to do so when the culture around us is deeply bathed or imbued with images of selfish behavior.  Television and movies, in particular, are stained or imbued with too many scenes of violence.  I am pleased when I see film images of American youth touched by or imbued with patience, kindness and good sense."

The old, winding streets and antique buildings had remained for over two centuries in an immutable , constant state due to the town’s isolation from the rest of the world.

Narcissism,When that person is consumed with self-admiration.,"Narcissism comes through “Narcissus,” a character in Greek mythology who fell madly in love with himself, lulling himself into a “numbness” or “deadness” of extreme self-absorption.

After all, he just started two months ago in this nascent job.  I told him that the concept of web design itself was in its developing, nascent stage not long ago, and it looks very promising.

Tara asked him if he should be studying, but the unconcerned Ted replied nonchalantly , “I have all night after we get back.  It will be easy!”  Ted’s nonchalant , casual attitude made the trip to the shore fun, but most definitely did not help his poor final grade in organic chemistry."

She usually kissed his cheek warmly when he helped her with her coat, but tonight Maxine pecked his cheek with a little less warmth than usual, an uncharacteristic nuance or shift.  Maxine had a slight edge in her voice as they chatted over dinner; Marcello realized that this small difference or nuance in her tone must mean something, but he just couldn’t figure out what.

By deliberately obfuscating or obscuring what you want to say, you make it hard for most readers to understand, so they will probably not be regular visitors.

Although one may find a typewriter here or there still in use, well over 99.9% of people now use computers to do their writing instead of the obsolescent or out-of-date typewriter.

A local painter used oils to capture the rich, diverse panoply of colorful marchers and dancers as they passed by."
Pantheon,A body of important people that represents the best of a certain group.,"A pantheon is a group of “all the gods” of a people, such as the pantheon of Greek or Roman gods.

At one time, it was believed that the slow, careful study of a subject was the best paradigm or model.  This paradigm or way of thinking was later rejected as research showed that games and interactive engagement with the subject had a greater impact on learning.  It seems the combination of the two has been the latest paradigm shift, as ways of thinking about learning now pull evidence from both sides."

Another paradox is the difficult and absurd situation of the barber who only cuts beards of those people who do not cut their own, so he will only cut his own if he, in fact, does not do so. Paradoxes or self-contradictory statements express a surprisingly possible truth that is nevertheless somewhat unrealistic."

Throughout his life he was the paragon or outstanding example of a committed artist, working long hours and missing much of normal childhood activities for the sake of his musical career.

By trimming staff, they are able to pare down or lessen costs and thus save extra money.  As a result, millions of people cut back on or pare down their expenses as well, which in turn denies companies the revenue they need to hold onto their employees."
Pariah,Someone who has become a social outsider.,"The word pariah comes from a social group of Tamil Indians called “Paraiyar,” one of the lower members of the caste system in India.

Snape will often choose to be unreasonable because his pedantic nature leads him to place dull, precise regulations over people.  His obvious discomfort when other, less pedantic teachers allow rules to be broken shows in his short and angry replies to these more lenient actions.

Penury,Extreme want and need due to lack of money.,"Penury is the “state or condition of (having) almost or nearly” enough money, and hence one is lacking in it.","dearth, frugal, impecunious, indigent, parsimonious, paucity, privation","affluence, copious, luxuriant, opulent, pecuniary, profusion",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/penury.mp4,," Due to penury and true poverty, Isaac was forced to save every penny.

Soon, however, his perfidious actions were seen for what they were, and Anslow was relieved of duty for his disloyalty and unethical ways."

The phlegmatic Phil just didn’t show any enthusiasm or happiness in the same way as his brother."
Pillage,An angry mob that smashes store windows and takes everything inside.,"Pillage comes from a root word meaning to pluck; hence, pillaging is ""the state of plundering or plucking goods from others.","acquisitive, appropriate, arrogate, brazen, defoliate, denude, desecrate, enormity, expropriate, forage, impudence, indiscreet, malfeasance, overweening, purloin, temerity, transgress, unseemly, usurp","advocate, altruistic, bastion, bolster, clemency, decorous, inconspicuous, largess, magnanimity, munificent, philanthropy, politic, probity, propriety, unobtrusive",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/pillage.mp4,PlatoonThese soldiers are pillaging the village.," Throughout human history, it has been the habit of invading armies to destroy and pillage the homes and lands of their enemies.  It has always seemed unfair that it is the non-fighting, common people whose possessions are stolen and pillaged .

Today, when someone is being pilloried , he is also being publicly ridiculed.  When movie stars do something bad they are pilloried because every magazine will feature the “shocking” details of their misdeed, usually blowing everything way out of proportion."
Pinnacle,It is the highest level they can reach.,"Just as a “little feather” is pointed at the top, so too is a pinnacle the topmost and sharpest point.","acme, apex, apogee, consummate, denouement, edification, efficacy, forte, quintessential, sublime, surmount, zenith","decadent, effete, enervate, feckless, jejune, nadir, obsolescent, pallid, tyro",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/pinnacle.mp4,Legend of the SeekerA nervous Zeddicus tells Lord Rahl that his recent performance at his court has been the pinnacle of his career.," William considered winning the Nobel Prize for literature the absolute high point or pinnacle of his career.  There had been many other awards which had once seemed like the pinnacle or crown of his career, but William now firmly believes that there is no honor better than the Nobel Prize.

He made all of his stories engaging, adding enjoyable and piquant details that sparked my curiosity.  He is also a wonderful cook, using piquant spices and sauces to add mouthwatering flavor to his dishes.  Having my interests piqued and entertained by this highly motivating conversation was one of the best moments of my holiday."
Pithy,A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.,"When one speaks in a pithy fashion, one has cut one’s words down to the “pit or kernel,” that is, the essence only of what one wants to say.
origin:  Old English


Knowing language of origin or etymology is not important; but is sometimes interesting enough to make the word memorable. Only such words have associated maps.

His pithy representations of common folk rely on short, crisp pieces of dialogue that are nevertheless filled with meaning.  The pithy way in which he can say so much using so few words is a real talent.  His pithy , pointed manner of writing shows that he can condense his message into a format that captures his ideas without being too wordy."

Even in her own job, where she felt she earned a pittance or inadequate salary for her level of expertise, she would never deliver such a small amount of product.  She, however, did leave a pittance or very small sum of money for a tip, since the waitress also was not very attentive to her."
Pivotal,It’s a key moment that can bring about an accomplishment.,"The idea behind pivotal may be that when one pivots, one turns on a point; the word pivotal may come from a root word meaning to point or stab. Hence, a pivotal event is a turning point in one’s life.","apposite, apropos, cardinal, condign, crux, cynosure, epochal, germane, pertinent, requisite, salient, tangible","aberrant, bagatelle, chaff, detritus, disparate, dross, errant, fatuous, inane, incommensurate, incongruous, jejune, minutiae, superfluous, trifle, trite",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/pivotal.mp4,," Sarah would say that winning that writing contest was a pivotal , critical, and life-changing event.  She had been on the verge of giving up her dream of being an author, but this pivotal award was of such vital importance that it gave her hope.  After the pivotal and key contest, her fame as a writer continued to grow.  When Sarah now talks to students, she tells them to grab every opportunity, since one never knows which decisions will be pivotal and essential to changing your life completely."

Many businesses have sprung up around the need to detect the stealing of ideas or plagiarism .  Schools are paying for software programs that allow teachers to compare papers and determine if words are borrowed or plagiarized from online sources.

Walking inside, the plangent , loud beats of the hymn surrounded me, and I found I could not get away from their penetrating sadness.  When the strong vibrating sounds of the plangent organ began, I could no longer contain my sorrow, and I began to weep uncontrollably."
Plastic,They might wear the same clothes and like the same things as you.,"Just like plastic can be easily “molded or shaped” into just about any “form,” so too can a “plastic” person be either easily “molded” or influenced by others, or can change to fit any given circumstance.","acclimate, acquiesce, amenable, cede, docile, facile, malleable, meretricious, pliant, protean","discordant, dogmatic, fractious, immutable, incorrigible, monolith, obstreperous, parochial, recalcitrant",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/plastic.mp4,," The director never found much success because her critics claimed she was too plastic : her movies were too much like everyone else’s and she was too eager to please.

Sheila had never realized in film school that cutting through the plastic , false atmosphere of Hollywood would be so difficult."
Platitude,Statements that have been said so many times that they have come to mean very little.,"A platitude is about as “flat” or “broad” a statement as one can make, which is so general and so uninspiring that one can draw no wisdom or guidance from it at all.","bagatelle, banal, ennui, fatuous, hackneyed, inane, insipid, jejune, pedestrian, prosaic, specious, superfluous, trifle, trite, vapid","adage, aphorism, axiom, consummate, dictum, epigram, erudite, precept, profundity, sagacious, savant",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/platitude.mp4,," We were unimpressed when the new headmaster would use his empty platitudes : “Hard work will pay off!” and “Two wrongs don’t make a right!” were two of his favorites.  He never seemed to have anything original to say, but only issued seemingly helpful platitudes from morning until night.  When we lost our first soccer game, he came down to the huddle and said, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!”  His overused sayings and dull platitudes were so flat and boring that they didn’t mean anything to us, although he tried to pass them off as significant."
Plaudit,A standing ovation that brings loud applause from an audience.,A plaudit is a “clapping” of the hands or the “applauding” of someone for something that she has done.,"adulation, approbation, blandishment, encomium, extol, laudatory, paean, panegyric","abase, censure, denigrate, denounce, derision, diatribe, excoriate, tirade, vituperative",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/plaudit.mp4,YouTube: Louis CK Honors George CarlinGeorge Carlin is being given plaudits by this comedian.," I decided against being a doctor when I realized that it was only the praise, words of approval, and plaudits from others that I was looking for, not the work itself.

However, these ambassadors or plenipotentiaries do serve as formal representatives, and so are able to sign legal documents in lieu of their government leader."

Pluck,Spirit and boldness.,"From a root word meaning “hair.” Just as a hair can be plucked from an animal, so too must the animals heart (the seat of courage, or pluck) be plucked from it when it is slaughtered; the pluck of the animal originally referred to those organs which needed to be removed upon processing it.","audacious, bravado, brazen, bumptious, ebullient, effrontery, flagrant, flout, gumption, impertinent, impudence, intrepid, mettle, overweening, presumptuous, temerity, unfazed","abash, chary, circumspect, consternation, craven, daunt, demure, diffident, disconcert, disquiet, impassive, irresolute, pallid, reticent, timorous, tremulous, unobtrusive",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/pluck.mp4,," Rosamond has a lot of pluck and courage during basketball season.

The coach admired her bravery and pluck , so he gave her the chance; he realized that such pluck and determination was a necessary skill for the game."
Plummet,It’s falling from the sky at top speed.,"Plummeting implies great speed, which implies great weight “hurtling forth,” like heavy “lead;” of course, unless there is air resistance, all objects fall at the same speed.  Note that the notion of plummeting came first from “plumbing” by using “lead” to quickly sound the depths, as “lead” sinks at great speed in water.","abate, abolish, abysmal, allay, attenuate, attrition, curtail, diminution, extenuate, extirpate, obsolescent, quell, wane","addendum, augment, copious, crescendo, engender, foment, luxuriant, plethora, prodigal, profusion, rife, satiate, surfeit, unremitting",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/plummet.mp4,Road Runner and Wile E CoyoteWile E Coyote in the act of plummeting.,"  Plummeting home prices are making this a buyers’ market because the quickly falling prices are giving buyers many opportunities to find houses they like in their price range.  Unfortunately, with the plummeting stock market, fewer people have the money to spend on a new home because their stock values have steeply declined.  With fewer buyers, home prices will plummet or collapse even more, making the stock market fall fast in turn, a seemingly endless cycle."

The poignant , distressing descriptions of entire families falling sick and sometimes dying within days of one another remind us of how lucky we are to have modern medicine available.  What I find particularly poignant and heartbreaking are the brief entries listing the names of some of the people who got this terrible illness, and the sometimes fatal symptoms that arose because of it."

Even though Josephine rarely contributes anything of value to these meetings, it is politic and advisable to offer her opportunities to have a say, considering who she is.  Shunning her would be im politic and unwise, and would create an uncomfortable atmosphere in the firm.  It is best to be politic in this matter by maintaining a sensible front, even though we feel her input is useless."

I don’t usually listen to Celtic music, so maybe his performance is better than it is reputed or considered to be.

I guess that the band wouldn’t receive international respect or high repute if they were not talented."

The questions range from what a proper amount of restitution would be, to deciding whom would receive such financial repayment.  Most agree that the Holocaust victims or their children deserve some sort of restitution in the form of either giving back property lost or paying back money for damages and injury suffered."

Retrench,It lessens the money it spends to save funds.,"A “trench” is a “long, narrow ditch” that has been “cut” from the ground, in much the same way that the “trunk” of a tree is what remains after all the branches have been “removed by chopping.”  Hence, to retrench is to “cut” or “chop back” on all unnecessary expenses, and then take cover within one’s new “trench” in the hope of weathering the financial storm.","abate, abeyance, abnegation, abolish, abridge, abstinence, attenuate, cede, curtail, diminution, efface, excise, extirpate, pare, rarefy, truncate","accoutrement, addendum, aggrandize, augment, bedevil, beleaguer, beset, crescendo, distend, exorbitant, inordinate, interpolate, preponderance, prodigal, prodigious, proliferate",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/retrench.mp4,," When profits decreased that winter, Hal’s company committed to a plan of retrenching or reducing costs.

Revelry,A huge feast followed by singing and dancing.,"Revelry is like “war” because it “fights,” albeit mildly, against acceptable norms of behavior; hence, revelry, like a rebel, goes against the daily acceptable order of everyday life.  Note that, via Grimm’s law, the “b” of “rebel” and the “v” of “revel” are interchangeable.","affable, blithe, boisterous, buoyant, cavort, complaisant, concordant, congenial, convivial, droll, ebullient, effervescent, effusive, exult, felicity, fete, gambol, gregarious, jocular, regale","brusque, choleric, despondent, dirge, dour, ennui, irascible, lugubrious, melancholy, morose, recluse, saturnine, tedium, troglodyte, truculent",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/revelry.mp4,Dick Clark: New Year's Eve 2000Revelry fit to the momentous occasion.," Andrew and Toby went wild on their birthdays, treating themselves with sodas, two birthday cakes, and pizzas in a general merriment or energetic revelry that had people bouncing off the walls.

Rife,A school could have a problem with too many students cheating in classes.,"From a root word meaning to “flow through.”

Riveted,When it fully occupies your attention.,From a root word meaning “to attach.”,"accentuate, bedevil, beguile, comely, enthrall, epiphany, galvanize, mesmerize, nexus, pertinacious, piquant, reverie, ruminate, scintillating, sedulous, tantalize, transfix, unremitting, whet, winsome","abate, abortive, abstinence, adventitious, allay, alleviate, antipathy, assuage, eschew, inconspicuous, nondescript, obviate, odious, quell, refrain, repugnance, revile, unprepossessing",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/riveted.mp4,," While terrified of monsters and ghosts, Brenda nevertheless found herself riveted or fascinated by the local haunted house.

The large size of his decorated waistline was made even more rotund by the bright red fabric of his great costume.  Uncle Morris sort of resembled a rotund , spherical, 300-pound tomato."
Rubric,When certain guidelines need to be followed for an assigned essay.,"Medieval manuscripts often began with bold “red” letters which “framed” or headed the documents.

For example, if the assignment was a research paper, the rubric or set of instructions would indicate length, style, and number of sources to be used.

Ruminate,To think about or reflect on an issue for a long time.,"A ruminant, such as a cow or sheep, has a “rumen” or series of stomachs that attach to its “gullet” or “throat,” whose function is to digest grass.  Ruminants will often chew for hours on their cud, or partially digested mass of grass, that comes up from their “rumen” through their “throat” after they have swallowed it once already.

Sacrosanct,The constitutional right of freedom of speech.,Something sacrosanct is both “holy” and “sacred;” note that using two root words that both mean the same thing adds emphasis to the word.,"apotheosis, approbation, august, deference, deify, ecclesiastical, hallowed, idolatry, immutable, ineffable, inestimable, inimitable, lionize, luminary, numinous, pristine, unalloyed, unsullied, venerable","adulterate, captious, cavil, defile, denigrate, denounce, desecrate, excoriate, pillage, pillory, proscribe, taint, vitiate",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/sacrosanct.mp4,," After work each day, my father’s time in his quiet study was considered sacrosanct or sacred.

Sycophant,One who falsely praises those in authority to get something he wants.,A sycophant is a “shower of figs;” one possible explanation of this word is that sycophants would inform authorities about crooks who were illegally exporting “figs” from Athens.,"abase, abject, acolyte, acquiesce, adherent, adulation, blandishment, deference, entourage, fawn, lackey, laudatory, minion, obsequious, servile, specious, subservient, supine, unctuous, vassal","autonomous, bristling, contumacious, dissident, divisive, fractious, implacable, incorrigible, irascible, obstreperous, recalcitrant, refractory, restive",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/sycophant.mp4,," The seemingly harmless public official was clearly a self-serving sycophant who flattered superiors to obtain favors.  This lying sycophant or puppet spoke empty praises to anyone who would hear him for the purpose of making those people think well of him so he, in turn, could gain power.  This sycophant used such an excessive array of false compliments that he at long last wormed his way into a leadership position."

This symbiotic relationship consisted of the birds willingly cleaning the rhinos of parasites and bugs which they, in turn, ate.  The rhinos tolerated this symbiosis or shared exchange with ease by allowing the birds to roost on their backs."
Symposium,A formal convention of economists who meet to share ideas.,A symposium was originally an occasion in which the ancient Greeks “drank together” at a private house party; one of Plato’s dialogues in which he discusses the nature of love while drinking with friends is called the Symposium.

Some people even placed such talismans or protective objects around their homes to keep their hearth and family safe from harm."

He said compressing or tamping down the leaves prevented the loose tobacco from burning too quickly before he had a chance to enjoy it.  By tamping it down into the bowl of the pipe, he ensured the leaves would stay packed together, which meant he wouldn’t have to light it very often."

Tantalize,When it is very desirable but not attainable.,"Tantalize comes from the Greek mythological character “Tantalus,” whose punishment in the Underworld did not allow him to eat or drink, despite the fact that he was standing in water and grapes hung over his head; hence, to tantalize is to “treat like Tantalus.”","aliment, bedevil, beleaguer, comely, comestible, delectable, desiderata, enthrall, epicurean, hedonism, imbibe, palatable, piquant, potable, redolent, sybarite, toothsome, unremitting, winsome","abhor, antipathy, brackish, despicable, heinous, miasma, noisome, noxious, odious, repudiate, repugnance, unprepossessing, unsavory, virulent, vitriolic",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tantalize.mp4,YouTube: Shabam School: The Fox and the GrapesThe grapes are tantalizing the fox.," Thomas found the travel brochure tantalizing ; he longed for a trip to England, but realistically knew he couldn’t afford such a journey.

The agent told him that the airfares were at a special and tantalizing low price, but Thomas realized, with frustration, that the trip was still beyond his reach."
Tantamount,When it is identical to it.,"The idea behind tantamount is that one gives “so great” an amount “to (one) mountain” as to the next. “Mountain” in this case refers to a pile of something, like coins.

They argue that admitting to taking drugs is tantamount to or the same as being caught because any use of steroids whatsoever gives an athlete an unfair advantage.  Athletes are realizing that disclosing such information is tantamount or equivalent to being removed from the Olympics, and maybe even professional sports, for good."
Tautology,Unsolved mystery.,"When one “studies” a tautology, one sees that it says the “same” thing twice, hence it is a “study in sameness.”  Consider: the phrase “a solitary person who lives alone” is a tautology because it says the “same” thing twice.","circuitous, circumlocution, convoluted, diffuse, exuberance, fecundity, garrulous, grandiloquent, loquacious, luxuriant, prattle, profusion, prolix, verbiage, verbose","consummate, elocution, excise, incisive, laconic, perspicacity, pithy, succinct, terse, truncate, unadorned",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tautology.mp4,," When Hubert wrote the redundant phrase “wet water” in his essay, his professor marked it as a tautology in bold red pen, dryly observing that all water is wet.  When Hubert handed in his next essay, his professor marked the highly repetitive phrase “I myself personally” as yet another tautology , explaining that all three words meant essentially the same thing.  Hubert, failing to understand what the professor meant, made his teacher throw up his hands in frustration as he included not one but two needlessly wordy tautologies in his third paper: “dry desert dust” and “new innovation.”"
Tawdry,When it is of poor quality and uses inexpensive materials.,"In her youth, St. Audrey’s only fault was that she loved wearing jewelry made of gold. Later, after she reached sainthood, fairs were held in her honor, at which spectacles lace and golden necklaces were sold, which at first were of good quality, but which later became cheap and showy. Hence, St. Audrey’s lace became shortened to tawdry lace, which referred to the items which were now simply showy and tasteless.","accentuate, bedeck, brazen, delusive, dross, flamboyant, fulsome, garish, gilded, insipid, kitsch, meretricious, ornate, ostensible, ostentatious, plastic, specious, spurious, veneer","aesthetic, candor, dapper, debonair, inestimable, politic, probity, propriety, unadorned, unalloyed, unobtrusive, unsullied, urbane",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tawdry.mp4,," The tawdry , cheap, and showy necklace that had been passed down from generation to generation was something that no one would actually want to wear.  With many brightly colored beads, a flashy and tawdry lion’s head pendant, and lace ribbons scattered throughout, it was more comical than elegant.  In keeping with great-grandmother’s wishes the necklace was preserved, but wearing such a tawdry , tasteless, and inferior piece of jewelry was not something her heirs wanted to do."
Taxonomy,It creates a logical system of organizing living things into groups.,Taxonomy is the “law” that describes the “putting in order or arranging” of living things into a useful and organized system.,"accretion, agglomerate, aggregate, amalgamate, appellation, collate, compendium, echelon, gamut, gradation, hegemony, hierarchy, juxtaposition, nexus, pragmatic, triage, utilitarian","abridge, autonomous, byzantine, curtail, denude, dissolution, divest, homogeneous, nebulous, notional, vaporous, whimsical",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/taxonomy.mp4,,"  Taxonomy is the branch of knowledge that organizes animals into different categories.

Tito has been very health conscious for much of his life, which is why he has chosen to be a teetotaler by not drinking wine, beer, or liquor.  When going out with friends to bars, the drink of choice for this teetotaler is water with lime.  While some friends are annoyed with Tito for his teetotal ways, Tara finds his restraint from alcohol and dedication to his own health to be quite admirable."

His temerity , or irresponsible disregard for danger, quickly caught the eye of a nearby policeman.  The cop rushed after the speeder with similar, fearless temerity , rushing in and out of traffic.  When the driver stopped, the policeman was surprised to see the driver’s pregnant wife in desperate pain, so he understood the temerity or hasty daring with which the man had been acting."
Tempestuous,It has gotten violent and wildly out of control.,"“Storms” occur naturally at various “periods of time” during the year, linked to the seasons, which are also “periods of time.”  Hence, tempestuous outbreaks are “stormy” at given “periods of time,” and, like “storms,” are often highly unpredictable in their appearance and ferocity.","abandon, anarchy, boisterous, bristling, choleric, discomfit, disconcert, disquiet, febrile, frenetic, impetuous, irascible, obstreperous, paroxysm, rampant, tumultuous, unbridled, vehement, wanton","abstinence, aplomb, blithe, complacent, disinterested, equanimity, impassive, imperturbable, insouciance, lackadaisical, languid, lethargic, listless, nonchalant, nonpartisan, phlegmatic",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tempestuous.mp4,The Perfect StormTempestuous weather sends the crew into a panic.," The tempestuous wind tossed the airborne kite wildly about.

Other temporal activities based upon a brief period of time are jumping in the leaves in the autumn, swimming in the summer, and planting a garden in the spring.  Perhaps one favorable aspect of these worldly, momentary, and temporal activities is that they are enjoyed because we can only do them at certain periods, and anticipate them anew when they are gone."
Temporize,To cause a delay so that a moment of decision is postponed.,"To temporize is to “make time,” usually to cause a delay.","addendum, bombastic, circuitous, circumlocution, circumvent, confound, contravene, convoluted, demur, dilatory, elude, interminable, moratorium, protracted, subterfuge, tautology","abate, abridge, alacrity, attrition, capitulate, celerity, diminution, efficacy, expedite, incisive, minuscule, perspicacity, truncate, wane",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/temporize.mp4,," Sometimes lawmakers in the government will temporize , or delay a moment of decision, in order to keep a vote from taking place.  A well-known strategy of temporizing is to speak on and on in order to gain time, known as a filibuster.  Because the speaker takes up everyone’s time by temporizing in such a clever and deceptive manner, the vote is continuously delayed, a way of making time so that the bill will be killed."
Tenable,When it is supported by documented facts.,A tenable theory or castle is “capable of being held.”,"aphorism, bastion, empirical, erudite, extant, formidable, heuristic, impregnable, monolith, objective, pragmatic, precept, sagacious, savant, utilitarian, veracity, verisimilitude, verity","arbitrary, capricious, chimerical, conjecture, delusive, ephemeral, fatuous, hypothetical, illusory, nebulous, notional, quixotic, specious, spurious, tentative, tenuous, transience, waver, whimsical",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tenable.mp4,," Rupert’s position on the political issue was simply not tenable since he had presented no evidence to support it.  He indicated that global warming was a myth, and yet his argument was not tenable or reasonable since he gave nothing but his stubborn, poorly informed opinion.  Until we see more tenable facts and reasons from Rupert, of which there are plenty to support global warming, we will consider his argument not defensible."

He only gave up his tenacious , unyielding hold on the bone when his owner offered him a ham sandwich in place of it."
Tendentious,One tries to influence opinion by giving a one-sided argument.,"When one is tendentious in one’s speech, one is “of the nature of being in the condition of stretching” towards one particular viewpoint in favor of all others, and is trying to get opinions of others to “stretch” in that direction as well.","adherent, advocate, aficionado, animus, antipathy, bigotry, divisive, dogmatic, exponent, factious, inequitable, insidious, jaundiced, opine, pontificate, proselytize, remonstrate, schism","autonomous, candor, disinterested, ecumenical, empirical, impassive, imperturbable, ingenuous, insouciance, liaison, nonchalant, nonpartisan, objective",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tendentious.mp4,," When Marla talks about how bright her daughter is, she is clearly being tendentious or biased.  Maria will compare her to the smartest kids in the class, and explain in a tendentious or one-sided viewpoint that her child didn’t get the top score only because she was sick that day.  In being so tendentious or prejudiced, she makes excuses for her child, who really isn’t all that intelligent.  Her tendentious ways create a narrow fiction for her child, which could lead to much disappointment later in life."

Yarn has little tensile strength, as it can only be stretched so far before it breaks.  Wire is more yielding and able to be extended, so its tensile strength can support much heavier objects.  Because wire has good tension, it is a good tensile material with which to hang things."
Tentative,They are not finalized and could change at any time.,"When one is tentative about something, it must be “touched or felt” many times before a decision can be made about it because of one’s uncertainty.","apocryphal, conjecture, craven, deliberate, demur, desultory, diffident, ephemeral, ersatz, fallacy, hypothetical, irresolute, notional, oscillate, precarious, temporize, transience, tremulous, vacillate, vagary, vicissitude, waver","adduce, adjudicate, assay, audacious, bravado, brazen, dogmatic, empirical, formidable, heuristic, monolith, objective, sanguine, tenacious, utilitarian",https://cdn0.membean.com/video/examplevids/tentative.mp4,," Simon tentatively closed the lid on the box, hesitating because he wasn’t sure he was ready to sell his precious books.

Sadly, Trey’s passionate feelings for Jill went unrequited until his death—she never felt love for him in return.
